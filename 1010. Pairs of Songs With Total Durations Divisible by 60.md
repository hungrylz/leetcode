# [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60)

### Solution

(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

The sum is divisible by 60 which means the sum of two remainders divided by 60 are also divisible by 60.

( time[i] % 60 + time[j] % 60 ) % 60 == 0.

#### HashMap
```
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> hashmap = new HashMap<>();
        
        //Use hashmap to store the remainder of 60, and the frequence of each remainder.
        
        int result = 0,countZero = 0;
        
        // count the numbers of exactly divisible by 60.
        
        for(int t : time){
            if(t % 60 == 0) countZero++;
            int temp = t % 60;
            int comp = 60 - temp;
            
            //get the remainder and complementary number.
            
            if(hashmap.containsKey(comp)){
            
            // if complementary number exists in hashmap, then get the increment.
            
                result += hashmap.get(comp);
            }
            
            hashmap.put(temp,hashmap.getOrDefault(temp,0)+1);
        }
        return result + (countZero*(countZero-1))/2;
        //get permutation and combination of the numbers that can be divided by 60, C(n,2).
    }

            result += c[(600-d)%60];
            
            /* (600-d)%60 exclude the situation that when d is the multiple of 60, the remainder is 60. Such as(60-d%60),make sure that                 when d is a multiple of 60 the remainder is 0.*/
