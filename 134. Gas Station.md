# [Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)



#### Brute Force
1. straightforward way to do this is to set each element as the start station and check if it can run over the whole circle. And there are two ways to make it faster.  

time complexity is O(n^2), space complexity is O(1)
````
/*
1 cost[i] > gas[i] can't be the first index

2 sum of cost > sum of gas return -1
*/

class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int length = gas.length;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++){
            if(gas[i] < cost[i]) continue;
            int g = 0;
            int n = length;
            int j = i;
            while(n > 0){
                g += gas[j];
                g -= cost[j];
                if(g < 0) break;
                if(g == 0){
                    j = (j + 1) % length;
                    break;
                }
                j = (j + 1) % length;
                n--;
            }
            if(j == i) return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

#### One Pass
we use cur sum to check if current start station works. Then use the total sum to check if there is a solution.
````
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        // last = -1 means there is no start station right now.
        int last = -1, total = 0, cur = 0, tmp = 0;
        // use total to get the whole sum. use cur to get the current sum of elements from start station to current index.
        
        
        for(int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++){
            tmp = gas[i] - cost[i];
            total += tmp;
            cur += tmp;
            // if there is no start station before i and cur > 0, current i is the new start station.
            if(cur >= 0 && last < 0) last = i;
            // cur < 0 means current start station can't reach the ith station. 
            // so we reset the cur to 0 and last to -1.
            if(cur < 0) {
                last = -1;
                cur = 0;
            }            
        }
        // total to count the whole array, if total < 0, there is no solution and return -1.
        /*
        [3,3,4]
        [3,4,4]
        */
        // 
        return total >= 0 ? last : -1;
    }
}
